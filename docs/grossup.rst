The grossup consists of including due taxes and service fee into a given
principal augmenting it so its resulting net value equals the originally given
principal.

It seems fairly reasonable to assume the service is simply an aliquot applied
over the principal so, if :math:`S` is the principal and :math:`g` is the
service fee aliquot, then the service if given by :math:`gS`.

On the other hand, it is hard to pin down a reasonable and generic expression
for a tax being applied over the principal, since taxes are very context bound
and their rules might be revised as laws are amended.
